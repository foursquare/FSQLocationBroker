 Callback block when the subscriber finds an acceptable location or times out or fails due to an error.

 @param location    A location matching the specifications you set or the location with the best horizontal 
                    accuracy that the subscriber was able to get within the cutoff time. 
 
                    This location will not be older than the requested maximumAcceptableRecency.
 @param elapsedTime The amount of time the subscriber took to get your location (boxed NSTimeInterval).

                    called synchronously, this value will be nil.
 @param error       The system location manager error if this block is being called due to an error, else nil.
