## 1.4.0 (2017-04-18)

Features:

- Ensure `currentLocation` is most recent location.
- Separating `subscriberShouldRunInBackground` from needing to be a continuous location subscriber.

## 1.3.2 (2017-04-06)

Features:

- Fix modulemap bug for Xcode 8 builds.

## 1.3.1 (2016-05-19)

Features:

- Fix bug where a subscriber running in the background could fire its completion block multiple times.
- Fix bug where the completion block might not return a location if a location with the maximum desired accuracy wasn't found.

## 1.3.0 (2015-10-27)

Features:

 - Added Carthage/framework support. There is now an Xcode project that has schemes to build two frameworks (one for regular apps, one that supports only app-extension apis). The recommended way to use FSQLocationBroker is now to add these frameworks to your project by adding the repo to your Cartfile with Carthage.
 - `FSQSingleLocationSubscriber` now calls `stopListening` before executing callback blocks instead of after, so that its state will be correct if you check it from those callbacks.
 - The `currentLocation` property is now atomic instead of nonatomic.


## 1.2.0 (2015-09-10)

Features:

 - Background location updates are now automatically disabled if your bundle does not have the correct background mode or if the user has only granted you "When in Use" permissions.
 - Improved handling of iOS 9's `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates` property.
 - Changes to `FSQVisitMonitoringSubscriber`'s `shouldMonitorVisits` property are now monitored through KVO.
 - For performance reasons, the broker now caches its own copy of `currentLocation` instead of passing through to the property on `CLLocationManager`.

Bugfixes:

 - Fixes crash when `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates` was incorrectly enabled in an app without the correct background mode.


## 1.1.2 (2015-07-06)

Features:

 - Add support for background location in iOS9

Bugfixes:

 - Many changes to how region subscribers work to fix issues. Re-connecting regions subscribers to monitored regions from previous app launches should now work as expected.

## 1.1.1 (2015-04-07)

Bugfixes:

 - This fixes a critical bug when building with newer versions of clang (Xcode 6.2+) where the broker would always think that the app was not backgrounded.
 - You must now define the FSQ_IS_APP_EXTENSION when compiling an extension in order to have unavailable apis compiled out.

## 1.1.0 (2015-04-02)

Features:

 - Add support for CLVisit.
 - Add changelog.

Bugfixes:

 - CLLocationManger methods are now correctly always called on main thread.
 - Guard against compiling in uses of UIApplication for extensions.
